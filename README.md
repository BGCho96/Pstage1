# Pstage1  
Very first clumsy version of my face labeling project. It aims to give correct label for a given image of human face.  
## task  
in short, 3 questions are asked :  
*Gender* : Male/Female  
*Age* : one of ~ 30, 30 ~ 60, 60 ~  
*Mask status* : masked, unmasked, masked incorrectly  
as a result, 18 classes are defined.
  
  
## Structure  
This is where it gets clumsy. Since this is my very first ML project, bunch of codes were plainly copied from guideline codes and it took time for me to digest it.  
then I disintergrated because thats what everyone else does(...)  
I divided them because i often got lost in the codes and i really need to get everything sorted, so i can do same task again with small time input.  
Hope this will help me get things sorted with less time input in future projects.

_score.py_|Filling in the bank space of the answersheet
_models.py_|Defining, loading models and parameters of pretrained/tuned model  
_mask_gender_age.py_|What u may call main()  

## And thats pretty much  X(
I guess i should have wrote this at the very begining, but what can i say? This is literaly my first readme.  
I literaly googled for 'how to make a good readme.md'.  
Im not sure i could check and work on any feedback(wish i could).  
If anyone is kind enough to leave comment and give suggestions, please do and help this poor newbie. ðŸ˜¢
